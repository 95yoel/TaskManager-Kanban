# TaskBoard

TaskBoard is a Kanban-style task manager application desinged to showcase my frontend development skills. It includes features like drag-and-drop and persistent storage to make the application useful.

To ensure seamless data persistence, I use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API" target="_blank">IndexedDB</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a>.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.7.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Task Management:** Organize tasks by dragging and dropping them across the colums.

- **Persistent Storage:** Save tasks using localStorage and IndexedDB for data persistence.
